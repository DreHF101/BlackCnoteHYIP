## How to Use the Debug Monitor

### 1. Visual Debug Monitor
The debug monitor appears as a small overlay in the top-right corner during development, showing:
- Browsersync status
- Vite dev server status
- HYIPLab API status
- React Router status

### 2. Console Logging
Check the browser console for detailed debug information:
- Router configuration details
- Service connection status
- Error messages and fixes applied

### 3. REST API Endpoints
Test the API endpoints directly:
- `GET /wp-json/blackcnote/v1/hyiplab/status` - HYIPLab status
- `GET /wp-json/blackcnote/v1/hyiplab/health` - Health check
- `GET /wp-json/blackcnote/v1/hyiplab/test` - API test

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development Environment
```bash
cd react-app
npm run dev:full
```

### 2. Monitor Services
- Check the debug monitor overlay
- Review browser console for status updates
- Use the diagnostic tools if needed

### 3. Live Editing
- Browsersync will automatically reload on file changes
- React hot reload is active for component changes
- WordPress theme changes are detected and applied

## Troubleshooting

### If Browsersync Still Shows as Not Running:
1. Check if port 3000 is available: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
2. Restart the development server: `npm run dev:full`
3. Check for port conflicts and kill existing processes

### If CORS Issues Persist:
1. Ensure the CORS plugin is activated
2. Check browser console for CORS error details
3. Verify the allowed origins in the CORS configuration

### If HYIPLab API Still Shows Errors:
1. Check if HYIPLab plugin is activated
2. Run the health check: `GET /wp-json/blackcnote/v1/hyiplab/health`
3. Review the diagnostic results for specific issues

### If React Router Issues Continue:
1. Check the router configuration in browser console
2. Verify the current URL structure
3. Test navigation between different routes

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `blackcnote/wp-content/themes/blackcnote/inc/debug-monitor-fix.php`
- `blackcnote/wp-content/themes/blackcnote/inc/hyiplab-api-fix.php`
- `blackcnote/wp-content/plugins/blackcnote-cors/blackcnote-cors.php`
- `react-app/src/config/router-config.ts`

### Modified Files:
- `blackcnote/wp-content/themes/blackcnote/functions.php`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes**: Refresh your browser and check the debug monitor
2. **Verify services**: Ensure all services show as running
3. **Test functionality**: Try navigating between pages and using features
4. **Monitor console**: Check for any remaining error messages

The debug monitor should now show all services as running correctly, and the development environment should be fully functional with live editing capabilities.
