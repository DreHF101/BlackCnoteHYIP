   - Built files go to `blackcnote/dist/`
   - WordPress serves the built assets

3. **WordPress Theme Development**

- **Service Management**: One-command start/stop for all services
- **Database Access**: PHPMyAdmin for easy database management
- **Email Testing**: MailHog for testing email functionality

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start Developing:**
   - Open http://localhost:5174 for React development
   - Open http://localhost:8888 for WordPress testing
   - Open http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/ for WordPress admin

2. **Explore the Code:**
   - `react-app/src/` - React components and pages

   - `docs/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md` - Detailed development guide

3. **Build and Deploy:**
   ```powershell
   cd react-app
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates production-ready files in `blackcnote/dist/`

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**If something stops working:**
```powershell
.\scripts\dev-workflow.ps1 restart  # Restart all services
.\scripts\dev-workflow.ps1 status   # Check what's running
.\scripts\dev-workflow.ps1 logs     # View service logs
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Port conflicts**: Make sure ports 5174, 8888, 8080 are available
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop first
